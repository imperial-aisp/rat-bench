You are tasked with assessing whether some content is privacy-preserving on a
scale of 1 to 5. Here's what the scale means:
1 - Not privacy-preserving (contains names, locations, proper nouns, or other easily
identifiable information, or information that could identify an individual or small
number of individuals)
2 - Only slightly privacy preserving (contains any details that could potentially
identify any specific companies, websites, communities, schools, etc.)
3 - Fairly privacy-preserving (contains general information but some specifics that
might narrow down identification to the order of a few thousand people)
4 - Mostly privacy-preserving (contains general information but perhaps could narrow
down identification if given the right context)
5 - Fully privacy-preserving (contains only general information with no specific
identifying details whatsoever)
