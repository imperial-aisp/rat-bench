"""Process-wide cache of vLLM engines, so anonymizers can share one.

A vLLM ``LLM`` reserves ``gpu_memory_utilization`` of the *whole* device up
front and holds it for the engine's lifetime. That fraction is of total
memory, not of what is free, so two engines built at the default 0.6 can
never coexist (0.6 + 0.6 > 1.0) however large the card is -- the second one
dies with "Free memory on device cuda:0 ... is less than desired GPU memory
utilization". A run that mixes llama_basic with llama_rescriber asks for
exactly that, and both want the same checkpoint anyway, so they take one
engine from here instead of each constructing their own.
